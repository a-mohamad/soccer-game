\section{Introduction}

The software project is about generating a soccer game where there are two players:
a goalkeeper and a striker. You have 60 seconds to score as many goals as possible,
after each goal is scored your score increments and the game is paused. You can resume
the game by pressing key R or by going to the menu option selecting control which has a
sub menu resume and pause. To score a goal the striker can move by pressing up down left
right key and to score a goal striker has to press space key. The goalkeeper randomly defends
the gate by moving in the left and right direction bounded by the gate's length. After the
timer becomes 0 the user gets the statistics of how many goals the striker has scored and how
many saves has the goalkeeper made. When the game is over, the user can start playing again
by navigating to the menu bar, clicking on the Game menu and clicking to a new game or exit
if the user wants to end playing. The main-goal of this software project is to use OOP concepts
and efficient software design patterns to write code efficiently and follow the DRY principle
which is (Don't repeat yourself). In this software project, to properly organize our soccer
game system, the system is divided into a set of layers where each layer focuses on a
specific aspect and has an abstraction level. MVC architectural pattern is used to divide
the system into three main subsystems where the model comprises data of the system, for
example keeping record of total goals and saves of striker and goalkeeper respectively.
The view consists of the user interface part where the data in the model subsystem can be
viewed. The controller which handles interaction between the modal and the view. The detailed
design of the software system can be seen using creational design patterns such as factory
design pattern as well as prototype design pattern which focuses on creation of objects.
For example players are created via the PlayerFactory class which has getplayer method
which takes string as parameter. All that is needed to pass is a string and it will
return the appropriate object. Doing a project with partial implementation takes time
to understand the logic and the functionality of code written. It took a while until
we all understood what is the role of each subsystem, once we got that it was easy to
implement and finish the rest. Based on our understanding of this software project we
are going to write the report with the basic idea and the designs implemented for the
top level and organization of the software project. We will create a UML diagram to make
our explanation of the design patterns used more clear. We will then explain the main
elements in this system and explain their functionalities. We will conclude our report
by giving brief overview of our journey in building this software project.

\section{Front end}
\subsection{Overview}
The front end of this project is implemented using the MVC design arcitecture. We have the components
of our front end separated into the \code{soccergame.view} package and the controllers into the \code{soccergame.controller} package.
This creates a separation of concerns between the classes which makes the development process easier.
The main component of the front end is the GamePanel calss. It is where everything is displayed and managed by the controllers
so the user can interact with the soccer game. The entry point to our program is the MiniSoccerApp class, which initializes
all the components and sets up the GUI frame with the GameMenuBar and the GamePanel.

\end{center}
\clearpage

\section{Classes}
\subsection{MiniSoccerApp}
The main runner class which runs the whole project. It is the entry point to the whole project and as such,
it initializes most of the other classes in preperation to run as expected. This is where the
GUI is also constructed and displayed from.
\subsection{GameMenuBar}
This class represents the top portion of the view which has various controls such as resume, pause, new game, end game, and quit.
This makes it easy for the user to control the application. To provide even more options for the user
each of the menu bar optios have their respective keyboard shortcuts. The menu bar is where the state and flow
of the game is managed by the user.
\subsection{GamePanel}
This class initiates the soccer game and gives user a visual representation of the game inside the GamePanel. All the visual components
such as soccer ball, game players, soccer gate, etc. are managed and repainted by this class. This
class also is composed of a SoccerGame class which helps it maintain the state of the game on the GamePanel.
The repainting tasks of the dynamic elements such as the goalkeeper, the striker and the soccer ball are updated per a
timer schedule. With these components this class is the main way to setup and repaint our soccergame whenever
something changes.
\subsection{GameListener}
This is a control class which helps to listen for keyboard actions from the user. For this proect, this listener listens
for the inputs of they keys left arrow, right arrow, up arrow, down arrow, and the space bar. This listener is used
to update the model in response to the users key presses. To be more specific, the Striker is the part of the
model this listener updates. So whenever the player position updates after a keypress, the timer task
in the GamePanel will accordingly repaint the correct positions when it is time to run.
In this way we can simulate the player moving accross the soccer feild in response to the users input. To
update the active players this class is composed of a GamePanel with the instance of the soccer game.
From the GamePanel we can get the instance of the game and get the active player and update their
position accordingly.
\subsection{MenuBarListener}
This is a control class which connects model and view. This class gives the functionality of resume and paused buttons so when
paused button is pressed the whole game is paused along with the timer and when resume button is pressed game resumes. there is also
a new Game button which loads and starts a new game and also the ability to quit the application. This class
listens to our GameMenuBar for these options and accordingly updates the model accordingly.
For example, when a new game is selected, it repaints the GamePanel and model effectively.

\section{Back end}
\subsection{Overview}
In this software project we are using combination of factory design pattern and prototype design pattern.
we have used combination of both in such a way that we are fulfilling the goal of factory design by hiding the
creation of object. prototype design pattern is used here keeping performance in mind i.e. other players such as
GoalKeeper and Striker doesnt have code repitition since they extend an abstract GamePlayer class which contains
necessary common methods thus reducing code repitition and keeping up the DRY rule which is (Dont repeat yourslef).

\end{center}
\clearpage

\section{Classes}
\subsection{GamePlayer}
This is one of the important class required in this software project it is an abstract class
and contains  essential methods such as moveLeft, moveRight, moveUp, moveDown, shootBall. without the GamePlayer
class there is no existence of two players the goalKeeper and striker without which the soccerApp has no meaning.
\subsection{GoalKeeper}
This is the class which fulfills the role of goalKeeper. it keeps record of number of saves through
playerStatistics class. it has functionality of moving randomly left-right guarding the goalpost.
\subsection{Striker}
This is the class which fulfills the role of a striker. the purpose of moving near to the goalpost
and scoring goals is what this class does with the help of methods inherited from its parent GamePlayer such as
movingUP down left right and shooting the ball.
\subsection{PlayerStatistics}
This class contains the statistics such as score. It helps keep track of a players score using its score feild.
Thus it has the necessary methods to manipulate the score.
\subsection{PlayerCollection}
This class is a custom data structure used to store a list of GamePlayer objects. It has functionalities such as
sorting a list of players based on score, retreival of players, insertion of one or more players, and
the abbility to use a custome iterator to iterate the list of players. This class
uses inner classes Node, and PlayerCollectionIterator to acheive these functionalities.
\subsection{PlayerCollectionIterator}
This class is a custom iterator class used to help iterate our list of players in our PlayerCollection datastructure.
It simply traverses from the head Node of the PlayerCollection and returns the next GamePlayer if
it exists.
\subsection{PlayerFactory}
This class is a factory class that implements the factory design pattern and helps to create players by
the player name. The only functionality for now is the abbility to create a GoalKeeper and a Striker
with a predefined color.
\subsection{SoccerGame}
This class contains all the important aspects as it has the object notations of the other classes like PlayerCollection and it then
calls the PlayerFactory class to further initiate the GamePlayer(goalkeeper and striker).
\subsection{SoccerBall}
This class represents the ball of the game and deals with the positioning of the ball when in play. It is a static Singleton
class to make sure that we only have one instance of the ball at all times.

\clearpage

\subsection{OOP Principles}
\textbf{Abstraction}: In this software project, some unnecessary details are hidden from other classes. We will give you examples
where abstraction is used. Take a look at the PlayerFactory class which is used to generate players such as goalkeeper
and striker. The way object is created is completely hidden, what is done is a string is passed such as "goalkeeper" or
"striker" and object is returned.

\textbf{Encapsulation}: In this software project, you will see the concept of encapsulation used where some logical implementation
required for some classes to give required functionality is set to private so that other classes cannot access it.
Examples such as GamePanel class has private paint methods such as paintPausedText(), paintGate(), paintPentaltyLine() etc
as they are only required for the proper implementattion of the GamePanel class.

\textbf{Inheritance}: The concept of Inheritance is one of the most required principle used in this software project for better performance reasons.
The GamePlayer class which is the parent class of goalKeeper and striker, doing this has enabled us to reduce code repititoin significantly.
No child class even needed their own fields all they have is methods implemented which they inherited from GamePlayer class.

\textbf{Polymorphism}: In this software project the concept of polymorphism is also used. You will see in the PlayerFactory class that
players are instantiated with the syntax GamePlayer goalKeeper = PlayerFactory.getPlayer(“goalkeeper”) which upon decoding means Goalkeeper goalkeeper = new GoalKeeper();
Polymorphism means “many forms” therefore though the object created is of the GamePlayer class but the methods takes form according to the
new SpecificPlayer() where (SpecificPlayer- goalkeeper, striker) and whenever any method is invoked such as striker.shootBall()it uses the implementation
of that specificPlayer class though the instant type is GamePlayer this happens because of inheritance where it is considering the latest form of the method.
Therefore if it is GamePlayer goalkeeper =  new GoalKeeper() and if goakKeeper.shootBall() is invoked this will call the
latest implementation of shootBall() which is implemented in the GoalKeeper class.

\subsection{Design Patterns}
\textbf{Singleton}: The singleton design pattern is used for the SoccerBall class to maintain one instance of the
gall throughout a soccer game instance. This assures us that we will always be manipulating one ball
whenever the game players interact with the SoccerBall class. Along side the GamePlayer classes, the SoccerGame class
also uses the SoccerBall class to manage some of the game functionalities such as \code{automateGoalKeeper()}. \\ \\
\textbf{Iterator}: The iterator pattern is used in our PlayerCollection datastructure. More specifically, we use a custom inner class
iterator called PlayerCollectionIterator which helps iterate over the list of players in our PlayerCollection. Because PlayerCollection
implements Iterable, we have the ability to use java features such as enhanced for loops. This
pattern is used wherever theses enhanced for loops are used or where the iterator is explicitly used. \\ \\
\textbf{Factory}: The factory design pattern is used in the PlayerFactory class. This class
helps us to create the GoalKeeper and Striker GamePlayer classes via their player name. This factory class
is used by the SoccerGame class to initialize the goakKeeper and striker into a soccergame.

\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Class Implementation}
This projects after reading all the requirements and design steps was initializing a java
gradle project using \code{gradle init} task, then customizig it to fit our project. After this, we started implementing
the required classes in IntelliJ or Eclipse. Since our team used git we were able to work on different development environment.
The IDEs in combination with gradle helped us compile and run our project. After the inital setup was completed, we iteratively
started working on the classes while testing them. The key members in testing our project so we improved our
coverage were Saniz, Akif and Hasnain. Using gradle helped to manage \code{jacoco} and \code{junit} dependencies so we can use
the TDD (Test driven development). We compiled our java classes with java 16 with the help of our IDEs and the \code{gradle run} command.
In this project, gradle is used it to manage the look and feel dependencies, create a \code{jacoco} coverage report, and provide an easy
way to run the project. Git was used along with Github so our team could collaborate effectively (this came in handy since we were all in different
time zones).

\subsection{Player Collection}
The player collection is a custom collection build using an interanal node and iterator class. The PlayerCollection class
implements iterable so we can iterate over an internal doubly linked list of GamePlayer objects.
This is where the iterator design pattern is used.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, basicstyle=\small]
	// custom Node of doubly linked list
	class Node
        GamePlayer data;
        Node next;
        Node prev;

        Node(GamePlayer data)
            this.data = data
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Sorting}
Within the player collectoin we use a simple bubble sorting algorithm to sort the linked list.
This helps to sort the players by their statistics.

\subsubsection{Pseudocode Code}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, basicstyle=\small]
	// bubble sort
    fun sort() 
        Node current, index
        GamePlayer temp
        if (head != null) 
            for (current = head; current.next != null; current = current.next) 
                for (index = current.next; index != null; index = index.next) 
                    if (current.data.compareTo(index.data) > 0) 
                        temp = current.data
                        current.data = index.data
                        index.data = temp
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{JavaDoc}
Generating the JavaDoc is easily possible through the \code{gradle javadoc} task. This will generate the
corresponding \code{index.html} for the projects documentation in the \code{build/docs} directory.
\subsection{Jacoco}
We use gradle to manage the Jacoco library dependency. We only test the model class as specified
in the requirements. The tests covered each case and we managed to get 100\% coverage.

\subsection{Execution}
Using github actions, we made sure that our build was dependent on our unit tests. On GitHub we have
incorporated tags in the README with the build state and the coverage state. As of currently, we have
100\% coverage with a passing build.

\section{Tools}
\subsection{Source Code}
\textbf{IDE}: IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2.1 and Eclipse, to implement Java classes\\
\textbf{Documentation}: vscode, \LaTeX, for documentation (dessign report, etc.)
\subsection{Build}
\textbf{Build}: Gradle 7.2 (to manage dependencies and build)\\
\textbf{Java Version}: openjdk version "16.0.1" 2021-04-20\\
\textbf{Version Control}: Git with Github \\
\textbf{Unit Testing}: junit-jupiter-engine:5.8.1\\
\textbf{Coverage}: JaCoCo library, Codcov\\
\textbf{Github Actions}: used to neatly assert validity of tests before pull requests and pushes to main

\section{Conclusion}
This software project helped us to work as a group and also get an insight of how to collaborate while working on the same project.
We learned how to work in team and coordinate with each other. This project also helps us understand the design principles and use
them in an adequate way according to the project need. One bad thing was that we tried to work on the whole project at once and finish
it up quickly. This turned out to be a bad idea. We stepped back a little and went through the code bit by bit and understood how the
code is connected and what’s missing. We also traced the code on a paper which helped us a lot. The things that I learned through the
journey of creating this software project is initial planning, if it’s a project which requires lot of demand to be fulfilled. I used
divide and rule principle where I breakdown the demands of this project into subpart and tried to find what should be the role of that
subpart in the project how many classes will be required and is there a way to implement code reusability by using OOP Principles. We also
learned how to work thoroughly with github and collaborate when working on the same project. We learned design principles which were taught
to us and how to implement them in our project. Another thing we learned is how to manage time efficiently as we were all in different time zones.
The advantages of working as a group is that we get to learn concepts from various perspectives. This opens the way to go forward and choose the
most efficient path to reach the final output. Disadvantages can be difficult to find a common time for collaborating, too many ideas to deal with, etc.
Few recommendations for easy completion of project for upcoming students are that they should ask for help understanding the flow of code
in the project, attend lab session and ask for help from TA, make sure that they understand the basic concepts of JAVA and also the software
concepts taught in the class.
